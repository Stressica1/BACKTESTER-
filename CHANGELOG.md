## [4.0.2] - 2025-05-28

### Fixed
- Enhanced `supertrend_pullback_live.py` signal generation with comprehensive error handling for all SuperZ analyzer calls, preventing unexpected keyword argument errors.

## [4.0.1] - 2025-05-27

### Fixed
- Fixed `SuperZPullbackAnalyzer.detect_signals()` to properly handle the deprecated `loosen_level` parameter which was causing TypeError exceptions for multiple trading pairs.
- Enhanced error handling in `process_symbol_lightning_fast()` to provide better fallback mechanisms when parameter errors occur.
- Improved error logging for API requests and data processing.
