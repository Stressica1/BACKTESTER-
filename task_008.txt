# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Parameter Optimization with Optuna
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate Optuna for hyperparameter optimization of trading strategies and develop visualization for optimization results.
# Details:
This task involves integrating Optuna into the backtesting engine for hyperparameter optimization of trading strategies. It includes defining optimization objectives (e.g., Sharpe ratio, total return), setting up parameter spaces for exploration, implementing visualization for optimization results, and developing a scheduler for running optimization tasks asynchronously.
