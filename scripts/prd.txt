# Bitget Trading Bot Fix Project - PRD

## Project Overview
This project aims to systematically identify and fix all issues in the Bitget trading bot implementation (supertrend_pullback_live.py). The bot has been experiencing persistent errors during execution that prevent successful trading operations despite numerous attempts to fix individual issues.

## Requirements

### 1. Code Audit & Analysis
- Run comprehensive linting with Ruff to identify all syntax, logic, and potential runtime errors
- Analyze error logs from previous executions to identify patterns and recurring issues
- Review the entire codebase for potential race conditions, memory leaks, and other performance issues
- Perform static code analysis to identify unused variables, imports, and dead code

### 2. API Integration Fixes
- Fix all Bitget API integration issues, focusing on proper parameter formatting
- Ensure correct leverage setting mechanism with Bitget's latest API requirements
- Fix account balance retrieval and reporting
- Implement proper margin mode selection (CROSS with HEDGE mode, not ISOLATED)
- Fix order placement parameter structure to match Bitget's requirements
- Implement proper error handling for all API-specific error codes

### 3. Trading Logic Fixes
- Fix position sizing logic to respect minimum order sizes while maintaining fixed USDT values
- Ensure SuperTrend calculation is mathematically correct and handles edge cases
- Fix signal generation algorithm to produce reliable trading signals
- Ensure proper execution of trades with correct parameters
- Fix retry logic to handle rate limits and temporary errors appropriately

### 4. Error Handling & Logging
- Implement comprehensive error handling for all API calls
- Create unified error logging system with clear error categorization
- Fix logging to provide useful diagnostics without excessive verbosity
- Implement proper exception handling for all async operations

### 5. System Architecture Improvements
- Fix race conditions in concurrent operations
- Implement proper async/await patterns throughout the codebase
- Fix memory management issues
- Optimize performance for high-frequency operations

### 6. Testing & Validation
- Create automated tests for critical components
- Implement integration tests for API calls with proper mocking
- Add validation logic for all inputs and outputs
- Create a systematic verification process for trading operations

## Constraints
- Must use existing framework (no complete rewrites)
- Fix issues in order of priority (critical errors first)
- Document all changes thoroughly
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing configurations
- Maintain the core trading strategy logic while fixing implementation

## Success Criteria
- Bot runs without errors for at least 1 hour
- All API calls are properly authenticated and formatted
- Trading signals are generated correctly
- Orders are placed successfully
- Proper leverage is applied before trading
- All error conditions are handled gracefully
- Memory usage remains stable during extended operation
