# Logical Dependency Chain
1. Foundation Components:
   - Data fetching module must be developed first to provide market data
   - Basic backtesting engine depends on data fetching
   - Risk management system integrates with both

2. Progressive Enhancement:
   - Start with basic volatility metrics before implementing complex calculations
   - Implement essential technical indicators before advanced ones
   - Build simple backtest visualization before complex interactive charts

3. Integration Order:
   - Develop core functionality before external integrations
   - Implement API endpoints before building UI components
   - Add optimization features after basic functionality is stable

# Risks and Mitigations  
## Technical Challenges
1. Risk: High-volume data processing may cause performance issues
   Mitigation: Implement efficient caching and data sampling

2. Risk: Real-time trading requires high reliability
   Mitigation: Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms

3. Risk: Exchange API limits may restrict data fetching
   Mitigation: Rate limiting, request batching, and data caching

## MVP Concerns
1. Risk: Scope creep may delay usable product
   Mitigation: Clearly define MVP features and prioritize core functionality

2. Risk: Complex UI may slow development
   Mitigation: Start with basic, functional UI and enhance incrementally

## Resource Constraints
1. Risk: Complex calculations may require significant computational resources
   Mitigation: Optimize algorithms and implement background processing

2. Risk: Concurrent users may overload the system
   Mitigation: Implement rate limiting and load balancing
