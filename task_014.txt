# Task ID: 14
# Title: Optimize analysis performance by 500x
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor data fetching and indicator calculations to leverage `asyncio`, multiprocessing, and vectorized operations for a 500× speed improvement.
# Details:
Implement asynchronous batch OHLCV fetching, vectorized SuperTrend and VHMA calculations, connection pooling, and caching to drastically reduce execution time.

# Test Strategy:
Benchmark optimized strategy against original implementation and verify at least 500× performance gain.
